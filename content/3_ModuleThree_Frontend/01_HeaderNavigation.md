# Building the Header Navigation

In this section, we'll create the header section of our dashboard with a navigation bar.

## Steps

**1. Create the Header Section**
   - Click "Browse templates" in the top section
   - Search for "Navigation bar with left aligned nav items"
   - Click "Insert"

**2. Add a Company Logo (optional)**
   - If you want to add a custom logo, click the default "Acme inc." icon at the top of the navigation bar and click delete
   - Click "Add Component", search for "Image", and click the image component
   - Click the image component and update the image URL in the properties panel
   - Adjust the size of the image for proper display

## Example
Here's how your header should look after completion:
<br>
<img src="/images/gifs/header-add-navbar.gif" width="700" height="350" />

## Next Steps
Once you've completed the header navigation, we'll move on to creating the filter section.
