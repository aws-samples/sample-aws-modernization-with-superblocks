# User Identification

In this section, we'll implement user identification features in our dashboard.

## Display User Information

1. Locate the User Icon
   - Find the user icon in the top right of the page
   - Select the icon component

2. Configure User Display
   - In the Properties panel, find the "Label" field
   - Enter the following JavaScript:
   ```javascript
   {{Global.user.name}}
   ```

## Understanding User Context

The `Global.user` object contains important user information:
- `name`: User's full name
- `email`: User's email address
- `roles`: User's assigned roles
- `permissions`: User's permissions

Example of accessing user properties:
```javascript
// Get user's name
{{Global.user.name}}

// Get user's email
{{Global.user.email}}

// Check if user has specific role
{{Global.user.roles.includes('admin')}}
```

## Best Practices

1. Always validate user context before displaying sensitive information
2. Use consistent user information display across your application
3. Consider implementing a user profile section for detailed information

{{% notice tip %}}
The user context is automatically maintained by Superblocks and is always available through the Global.user object.
{{% /notice %}}

## Testing

Verify that:
1. User name displays correctly in the UI
2. User context updates when different users log in
3. User information is consistent across the application

## Next Steps
Now that we have user identification set up, we'll implement role-based access control.
